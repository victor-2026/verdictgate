# Mutation Matrix Full

## Purpose
Measure whether your AI-generated tests actually catch deliberate defects (regressions), not just whether they pass on green code.

## How it works
Introduce a small, controlled defect (mutant) into the code under test. Run your test suite against it.

- If tests still **pass** → the mutant **"survived"** → your tests have a blind spot.
- If tests **fail** → the mutant was **"caught"** → your tests are sensitive to this type of defect.

## Key principle
Not every test must catch every mutation. A login test should not be expected to catch a price-calculation boundary flip. Track **Expected to catch** separately from **Actual result**.

---

## "Expected to catch" checklist
A test is marked **Expected to catch = Yes** only if **ALL** hold:

1. The mutation changes behavior in the area the test claims to verify
2. The mutation is on the same layer (UI/API/logic) the test covers
3. The mutation is **NOT** equivalent (it changes observable behavior for user/system)

If any fails → mark **Expected = No** (or **Equivalent**). This removes subjectivity and keeps the survival rate denominator meaningful.

---

## Step 1: Select tests
Pick 5–10 AI-assisted tests from your pilot. Note what each one claims to verify and its risk level.

| # | Test name | What it claims to check | Risk level (H/M/L) |
|---|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 |           |                        |                   |
| 2 |           |                        |                   |
| 3 |           |                        |                   |
| 4 |           |                        |                   |
| 5 |           |                        |                   |

---

## Step 2: Define mutations
For each test, introduce **ONE** deliberate defect. Keep mutations small and isolated.

### UI-level mutations (manual DOM / fixture change)
| Mutation type             | Example                              | What it simulates                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Locator drift             | `id="loginBtn"` → `id="login-button"` | UI/selector change between versions        |
| Selector broadening       | Remove `id`, use bare `button`       | Test becomes less specific                 |
| Element removed           | Delete a button/handler              | Missing functionality                      |
| Wrong element             | Swap two buttons' actions            | Logic error                                |
| Duplicate target ambiguity| Two identical buttons, matcher picks first | Text matcher picks wrong occurrence   |
| Validation removed        | Remove required-field check          | Business rule bypass                       |
| Navigation mutation       | Wrong redirect target                | Routing error                              |

### API-level mutations (mock server with mutated responses)
| Mutation type             | Example                     | What it simulates           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Status flip               | `200` → `500`               | Backend failure             |
| Missing field             | Response drops `balance`    | Schema drift                |
| Wrong type                | `amount: "abc"`             | Contract violation          |
| Permission/role           | User sees admin function    | Authz bypass                |

### Data mutations
| Mutation type             | Example                          | What it simulates                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Value change              | `price = 100` → `price = 0`      | Boundary / calculation error       |
| Date shift                | `expiry +1d` → `expiry -1d`      | Time logic bug                     |
| Text corruption           | Localized string broken          | i18n regression                    |

### Logic / state mutations
| Mutation type             | Example                     | What it simulates                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Boundary flip             | `>=` → `>`                  | Off-by-one / edge case             |
| Race condition            | Reorder async calls         | Concurrency bug                    |
| Session expiry            | Valid session → expired     | Auth state bug                     |
| State mutation            | Concurrent user edit        | Shared-state conflict              |

---

## Step 3: Run and record
For each mutation, run the associated test in an **ephemeral/sandbox environment only**. Record the result.

| Mutation ID | Date | Env | Layer (UI/API/DB/Logic) | Test   | Mutation applied   | Expected to catch? | Test result | Verdict    | Assertion quality | Review effort (min) |
| ----------- | ---- | --- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| M1          |      |     | UI                      | login  | id drift           | Yes                | PASS        | ❌ Survived | timeout (low)     |                     |
| M2          |      |     | UI                      | nav    | wrong redirect     | No                 | PASS        | n/a        | not applicable    |
| M3          |      |     | UI                      | submit | validation removed | Yes                | FAIL        | ✅ Caught   | clear message     |

### Verdict values (not binary)
- **Caught** — test failed on the mutant, as expected
- **Survived** — test passed on the mutant (blind spot)
- **Flaky** — test intermittently passes/fails
- **False alert** — test failed, but for the wrong reason (wrong assertion fired)
- **Equivalent** — mutation does not change observable behavior; excluded from survival rate
- **n/a** — mutation not expected to be caught by this test

> Calculator mapping: only Caught / Survived / Equivalent / n/a (+ Observed-only via the `observed` column) are CSV verdicts. **Flaky** and **False alert** are working states, not recordable outcomes — resolve them BEFORE recording: re-run a flaky case until stable (or quarantine the test, not the mutant), fix the assertion behind a false alert, then record the clean Caught/Survived. Recording an unstable row as a verdict corrupts the denominator.

### Equivalent mutants
A mutant is **equivalent** when it changes the code but not the observable behavior (e.g., `if (x > 0)` → `if (x >= 1)` when x is integer). These must be marked **Equivalent** and excluded from the denominator of survival rate — otherwise the metric is artificially inflated.

### Assertion quality
Rate how clear the failure message is:
- **High** — message explicitly points to the mutation (e.g., "balance field missing", "validation error expected")
- **Medium** — test failed but message is generic ("element not visible", "timeout")
- **Low** — unclear timeout/error requiring debug; prioritize fixing **Survived + Low** tests first

---

## Step 4: Calculate rates
```
Survival rate (FN) = (Survived (Expected=Yes, Verdict≠Equivalent)) / (Total (Expected=Yes, Verdict≠Equivalent)) × 100%
```
```
False positive rate (FP) = (Tests that FAIL on clean code) / (Total tests run) × 100%
```

**Note:** FP rate is measured **before** any mutation is introduced — run the same tests on unmodified code in the same environment. This prevents accidentally counting mutant-caused failures as false positives.

**Example from a commercial AI-QA platform run (M6-M9):**
- M6 locator drift: PASSED, expected=Yes → Survived
- M7 selector broadening: PASSED, expected=Yes → Survived
- M8 element removed: FAILED, expected=Yes → Caught
- M9 wrong element: FAILED, expected=Yes → Caught

Survival rate = 2/4 = 50%
Pattern: functional failures caught, structural fragility missed

> Track BOTH survival rate (FN) and FP rate. A test suite that catches everything but also fails on clean code is itself a liability.

---

## Step 5: Interpret
> Generic guidance for manual runs. When you feed results.csv to the calculator, the ENFORCED rules are the per-risk-tier gates (framework v0.3: B0/B1 zero-tolerance, B2 band, B3 trend-only) — this table does not override them.

| Survival rate | Meaning                     | Action                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0%            | Tests catch every expected defect | Strong — trust the signal          |
| <20%          | Minor blind spots           | Target the missed mutation types    |
| 20–50%        | Structural gaps             | Add mutation testing to CI as a gate|
| >50%          | Tests are weak              | Don't trust green dashboard         |

---

## Step 6: Map to risk level (concrete actions + measured effort)
Cross-reference survival rate with risk level from Step 1. **Track actual human review effort** to validate the "time cost scales with risk × survival rate" principle.

| Risk | Survival rate | Human review effort (min) | Gate decision |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| High | >0%           | 45–60 | Full manual re-review by senior QA; sign-off required before merge; artifact = reviewed diff + note |
| High | 0%            | 10–15 | Lightweight spot-check; artifact = mutation report attached to PR |
| Medium | 20–50%      | 20–30 | Targeted review of the missed mutation type; 30 min per flow |
| Low  | any           | 0–5  | No gate; rely on mutation trend |

**Human gate** = a named person reviews the mutation report and approves before the PR merges.

**Measured dimension:** After each gate, record actual minutes spent reviewing (column: `Review effort (min)`). This enables:
- Trend analysis: does review time decrease as survival rate improves?
- ROI calculation: is the time investment justified by defect detection?
- Baseline comparison: compare your High-risk review effort against other teams/pilots.

---

## Step 7: Regression / trend
Survival rate is a point-in-time metric. Re-run the matrix every iteration and track the trend.

### Minimum fields for aggregation
| Sprint | Risk | Layer | Survival rate | FP rate |
|--------|------|-------|---------------|---------|
| S1     | High | UI    | 45%           | 2%      |
| S2     | High | UI    | 30%           | 1%      |

- Falling survival rate = tests improving
- Rising survival rate = test debt accumulating
- Plot per-risk-level to see where quality erodes first

## Tooling notes
| Level       | Tools                        | What they mutate                          |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Code-level  | Stryker (TS/JS), MutPy (Python) | Source code — runs many mutants per execution |
| UI-level    | Manual DOM edit / test fixture mutation | Live UI elements (as described above) |
| API-level   | Mock server (WireMock, MSW)  | Response status, fields, types            |

> "One mutation per test-target pair" — for UI/API manual mutations, isolate one defect per run. For code-level tools (Stryker), the tool auto-mutates many points in a single execution; review its report per mutant.

---

## Meta-data for audit trail
Every mutation record should carry: **Mutation ID**, **Date**, **Environment**, **Layer**, **Owner**, **Status**. This enables repeatable runs, trend analysis, and shows which mutants are still open.

| Mutation ID | Date       | Env       | Layer | Test  | Owner | Status        |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|---------------|
| M1          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | UI    | login | QA-1  | Open          |

**Status values:** Open / Fixed / Accepted risk.

|-------------|------------|-----------|-------|------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| M1          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | UI    | login      | id loginBtn → login-button | Yes               | PASS        | ❌ Survived | timeout (low)     |

| M3          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | UI    | submit     | validation removed         | Yes               | FAIL        | ✅ Caught   | clear message     |
| M4          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | UI    | login      | swap buttons               | Yes               | FAIL        | ✅ Caught   | clear message     |
| M5          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | API   | fetch-balance | 200 → 500                | Yes               | FAIL        | ✅ Caught   | clear message     |
| M6          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | Logic | price-calc | `x>0` → `x>=1`             | Yes               | PASS        | Equivalent  | n/a (excluded)    |
| M7          | 2026-09-01 | sandbox-1 | UI    | nav        | wrong redirect             | No                | PASS        | n/a         | not applicable    |

### Calculation
- Expected-to-catch mutants (non-equivalent): M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 = 5 (M7 excluded: Expected=No)
- Survived (expected=Yes, non-equivalent): M1 = 1
- Survival rate (FN) = 1/5 = 20%

FP rate: tests that fail on clean code = 0 / 7 = 0%

**Interpretation:** 20% survival rate = minor blind spots. M1 (locator drift) is the gap — strengthen the login test's locator assertion. M6 excluded as equivalent. M7 not expected to catch (nav test, different scope).
